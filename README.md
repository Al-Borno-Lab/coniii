CONvenient Interface to Inverse Ising

ED Lee, BC Daniels

Python package for solving maximum entropy problems with a focus on the pairwise maximum entropy model, also known as the inverse Ising problem.

See Examples.ipynb for usage documentation.

This project is currently being developed and will be published with an accompanying guide on arXiv. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated!
