Python package for solving the inverse maximum entropy problem with a focus on the
pairwise maximum entropy model, also known as the inverse Ising problem.

See GitHub page for overview on how to install and use package.

Examples are included in the Jupyter notebook "usage_guide.ipynb" and the Python
script "usage_guide.py" (see GitHub). A somewhat outdated overview is also published in the
[paper](https://github.com/eltrompetero/coniii/blob/py3/guide/guide.pdf).
