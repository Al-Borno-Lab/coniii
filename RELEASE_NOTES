v1.1.9 (Released 2019/04/22)
----------------------------------------------------
- Added support for Potts models in new module enumerate_potts.py.
- Typos fixed in usage guide Jupyter notebook.
- Added Ising class in .ising module for wrapping some useful functions for use with the
  Ising model.

v1.1.8 (Released 2019/04/08)
----------------------------------------------------
- Bug fixes.

v1.1.7 (Released 2019/03/20)
----------------------------------------------------
- enumerate.py can now write files that handle arbitrary precision using mpmath. These are
  written to files using the prefix '_hp.py'.
- Interface bug fixes.
- Updated dependency requirements to later versions of numba and numpy and new dependency
  on mpmath.
- Some revisions to usage guide notebook.

v1.1.6 (Released 2019/03/12)
----------------------------------------------------
- Bug fixes.
- License date update.

v1.1.5 (Released 2019/02/24)
----------------------------------------------------
- Bug fixes.

v1.1.4 (Released 2019/01/06)
----------------------------------------------------
- Enumerate.solve() now uses scipy.optimize.root to find solution and is MUCH faster.

v1.1.3 (Released 2018/12/17)
----------------------------------------------------
- Update to Ising equation files in v1.1.0 to make them much smaller used Scipy's
  logsumexp function which is slow! With own light implementation, code is at least
  several times faster to evaluate.

v1.1.2 (Released 2018/12/16)
----------------------------------------------------
- Bug fix in type casting in Metropolis.generate_samples_parallel().
- convertTo kwarg for utils.convert_corr has been changed to convert_to to make it uniform
  with other functions.
- convert_to is no longer a keyword argument and is now a regular argument that must be
  specified as a string.

v1.1.0 (Released 2018/12/13)
----------------------------------------------------
- Bug fix in type casting in Metropolis.generate_samples_parallel().
- Now compatible with multiprocess v0.70.6
- Updated sampling method for Metropolis to be more efficient by running fewer systems for
  longer and taking iterative samples instead of starting with a completely new system for
  every sample (which takes longer to burn in and requires starting new processes). This
  is automated such that the number of samples is divided evenly amongst all running
  processes)..
- Added working version of ParallelTempering sampler.
- n_cpus and nCpus are now used to refer to number of allowed processes to spawn and got
  rid of cpu_count which can be confused in `multiprocess.cpu_count`.
- Improvements to enumerate.py: More compact Ising equation files and better precision by
  using scipy.special.logsumexp.
- Jupyter is no longer required for installation of ConIII by default.
- Ising functions (calc_e and functions that use it) assume that spins are now integer
  types. TypeError in jit is thrown if not. Updates to other functions for compatibility
  (e.g. utils.bin_states() return integer types).
- Removed use_numba switch for samplers.
- Removed FastMCIsing sampler.

v1.0.3 (Released 2018/11)
----------------------------------------------------
- First official release.
