Log for major changes


v1.1.0 (Released ??)
----------------------
- Now compatible with multiprocess v0.70.6
- Updated sampling method for Metropolis to be more efficient by running fewer systems for
  longer and taking iterative samples instead of starting with a completely new system for
  every sample (which takes longer to burn in and requires starting new processes). This
  is automated such that the number of samples is divided evenly amongst all running
  processes)..
- Added working version of ParallelTempering sampler.
- n_cpus and nCpus are now used to refer to number of allowed processes to spawn and got
  rid of cpu_count which can be confused in `multiprocess.cpu_count`.
- Improvements to enumerate.py: More compact Ising equation files and better precision by
  using scipy.special.logsumexp.
- Jupyter is no longer required for installation of ConIII by default.
- Ising functions (calc_e and functions that use it) assume that spins are now integer
  types. TypeError in jit is thrown if not. Updates to other functions for compatibility
  (e.g. utils.bin_states() return integer types).
- Removed use_numba switch for samplers.


v1.0.3 (Released 2018/11)
-----------------------
- First official release.
