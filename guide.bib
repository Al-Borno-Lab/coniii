nice thorough review of inverse Ising methods


they claim it's possible to have localized correlation changes lead to localized parameter changes AND localized parameter changes lead to non-localized correlation changes. ("the inverse Ising problem remains local even at the critical point") see section C


they use a method that discards clusters that do not contribute sufficiently to the entropy to remove dependence on small-sample noise},
